# Healthcare-Chatbot
# Overview
Project: Symptom-Based Disease Prediction Chatbot
Objective: Develop a chatbot that leverages machine learning to interpret user symptoms and predict potential diseases.
# Key Features
Symptom Analysis: Users input their symptoms, and the chatbot analyzes them to predict possible medical conditions.
Disease Prediction: Implements Decision Trees and Support Vector Classification (SVC) algorithms for accurate predictions.
Recommendations: Provides users with recommendations, including precautions and possible treatments, based on the predicted diseases.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of interaction, making health diagnostics accessible.
# Technical Details
Machine Learning Models:
Decision Trees: For interpreting symptoms and mapping them to diseases.
Support Vector Classification (SVC): Used to enhance classification accuracy.
Dataset: Utilizes a dataset mapping symptoms to diseases (available on GitHub or Kaggle).
Libraries:
Numpy, Pandas for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for building and evaluating models.
Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualizations.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) for voice interaction.
# Future Enhancements
Increase dataset size to improve prediction accuracy.
Add features like personalized recommendations and user history tracking.
Consider deploying the chatbot as a web or mobile app for wider accessibility.
